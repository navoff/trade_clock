# Product Context: TradeClock Android App

## Why This Project Exists

TradeClock was created to solve a specific problem for traders, investors, and financial professionals who need to keep track of global stock exchange operating hours. In today's interconnected global financial markets, knowing when different exchanges are open is crucial for:

1. **Timing trades** across different markets
2. **Understanding market movements** that may be influenced by other exchanges
3. **Planning work schedules** around key market hours
4. **Avoiding missed opportunities** due to exchange closure

## Problems It Solves

1. **Time Zone Confusion**: Manually calculating local times across different time zones is error-prone and time-consuming
2. **Information Accessibility**: Finding accurate exchange hours typically requires visiting multiple websites or sources
3. **Status Awareness**: Without a dedicated tool, users may not realize when exchanges open or close
4. **Information Overload**: Many financial apps provide too much information when users just need basic operating hours

## How It Should Work

The app should provide a straightforward, glanceable interface that:

1. Loads quickly and displays information immediately
2. Shows the current status of exchanges without requiring user interaction
3. Updates time information automatically while the app is open
4. Allows customization of which exchanges to display
5. Provides clear visual distinction between open and closed exchanges

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity**: The app should be focused on its core purpose without unnecessary features
2. **Clarity**: Information should be presented in a clean, easy-to-read format
3. **Reliability**: Time and status information must be accurate and update reliably
4. **Efficiency**: The app should use minimal system resources and battery
5. **Accessibility**: Information should be readable for all users, including those with visual impairments

## Target Users

1. **Day Traders**: Need to know when markets open/close to plan their trading day
2. **Global Investors**: Managing portfolios across multiple exchanges
3. **Financial Professionals**: Analysts, advisors, and others who monitor global markets
4. **Business Professionals**: Those who work with international clients in financial sectors
5. **Finance Students/Enthusiasts**: Learning about global markets and their operations
