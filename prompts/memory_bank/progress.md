## Current Status

The app is in a functional state with the core time display, update features, exchange filtering, and drag and drop reordering implemented. Users can see the current time in the header and the local time for each exchange, with automatic updates every minute when the app is active and immediate updates when the app is resumed. Users can filter which exchanges to display by selecting/deselecting them in edit mode, and can also reorder exchanges using drag and drop.

The most recent work focused on fixing a bug where the new order of exchanges wasn't being saved when the "Save" button was pressed. This fix ensures that users' custom ordering of exchanges is properly persisted to the database, providing a consistent experience across app sessions.

### Recent Milestone: Database Enhancement with New Exchanges
- Added Moscow Exchange (MOEX) with trading hours 9:50 - 18:50 Moscow time
- Added Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX) with trading hours 9:30 - 16:00 Hong Kong time
- Added NASDAQ with trading hours 9:30 - 16:00 Eastern time
- Standardized all schedule URLs to use tradinghours.com for consistency
- Enhanced global market coverage for users

### Previous Milestone: Bug Fix for Exchange Order Saving
- Fixed the bug where the new order of exchanges wasn't being saved when pressing Save
- Changed the order of operations in saveChanges() to save display order first
- Added error handling with try-catch block to better handle and report errors
- Ensured the display order is correctly saved to the database before exiting edit mode

### Previous Milestone: Drag and Drop Reordering
- Implemented long-press gesture to initiate dragging of exchange items
- Added reordering logic to update the list when items are moved
- Implemented haptic feedback for better user experience during dragging
- Enhanced the UI with visual feedback during drag operations
- Added persistence of custom order to the database

### Previous Milestone: Exchange Filtering Functionality
- Fixed issue where unchecked exchanges weren't disappearing after pressing Save
- Implemented showing all exchanges in edit mode
- Ensured checkboxes correctly reflect the selection state of each exchange
- Added proper database updates for exchange selection changes

## Known Issues

1. **Limited Error Handling**: Error states need more comprehensive handling
2. **No Persistence for User Preferences**: User preferences are not saved between sessions
3. **No Offline Mode Indicator**: No indication when the app is working offline
4. **Limited Testing**: Need more comprehensive test coverage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Initial Approach | Current Approach | Reason for Change |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Time Updates** | Timer-based approach | BroadcastReceiver | More efficient, battery-friendly, and aligned with system clock |
| **UI Framework** | XML layouts | Jetpack Compose | Modern, declarative approach with better state management |
| **State Management** | LiveData | StateFlow | Better integration with Kotlin Coroutines and Flow |
| **Database** | SQLite direct | Room | Type safety, better integration with Kotlin |
| **Exchange Filtering** | Filter in UI only | Database-backed selection | More robust, persists across app restarts |
| **Exchange Ordering** | Fixed order | User-defined order with drag & drop | Allows users to prioritize important exchanges |

### Feature Prioritization

1. **Initial Focus**: Core exchange display with static data
2. **Second Phase**: Time calculations and status display
3. **Third Phase**: Automatic time updates
4. **Fourth Phase**: Exchange filtering and edit mode
5. **Current Phase**: Exchange reordering with drag and drop
6. **Next Phase**: User preferences and additional sorting options

### Technical Debt

1. **Test Coverage**: Need to improve unit and UI test coverage
2. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling throughout the app
3. **Documentation**: Some code sections need better documentation
4. **UI Refinement**: Some UI components need design improvements

## Next Development Priorities

1. **User Preferences**: Add persistence for user settings using DataStore
2. **UI Improvements**: Enhance the visual design and add animations
3. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and UI tests
4. **Dark Theme**: Implement support for dark theme
5. **Additional Sorting Options**: Add ability to sort exchanges by different criteria (beyond manual ordering)

## Lessons Learned

1. **System Integration**: Leveraging system components like BroadcastReceiver can be more efficient than custom implementations
2. **Time Handling**: Working with time zones and time calculations requires careful consideration of edge cases
3. **State Management**: A single state object simplifies UI updates and state management
4. **Lifecycle Awareness**: Proper lifecycle management is crucial for resource-efficient apps
5. **Compose Benefits**: Jetpack Compose significantly simplifies UI development and state management
6. **Edit Mode Patterns**: Separating view mode from edit mode provides a cleaner user experience
7. **Database Integration**: Properly integrating database operations with UI state updates ensures consistent user experience
8. **Gesture Recognition**: Long-press gestures with proper feedback create intuitive interactions
9. **Third-Party Libraries**: Carefully evaluating and integrating libraries like Reorderable can save development time
10. **Haptic Feedback**: Tactile feedback significantly improves the user experience for interactive elements
11. **Operation Order**: The order of database operations can be critical, especially when multiple related updates are performed
12. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with try-catch blocks helps identify and resolve issues more effectively
