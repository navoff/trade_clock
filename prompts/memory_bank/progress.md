# Progress: TradeClock Android App

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Basic app structure with Clean Architecture and MVVM pattern
- ✅ Room database setup for storing exchange information
- ✅ Exchange list display with Jetpack Compose
- ✅ Current time display in the app header
- ✅ Local time display for each exchange
- ✅ Exchange status calculation (open/closed)
- ✅ Visual distinction between open and closed exchanges
- ✅ Automatic time updates every minute when app is active
- ✅ Immediate time updates when app is resumed

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Dependency injection with Hilt
- ✅ Reactive UI updates with Kotlin Flow
- ✅ Time zone handling with ThreeTenABP
- ✅ Lifecycle-aware components
- ✅ Efficient time updates using BroadcastReceiver

## What's Left to Build

### Core Features
- ⬜ Exchange filtering functionality
- ⬜ User preferences storage with DataStore
- ⬜ Sorting options (by opening time, continent)
- ⬜ Detailed exchange information screen
- ⬜ Search functionality

### UI Enhancements
- ⬜ Dark theme support
- ⬜ Animations for status changes
- ⬜ Improved visual design
- ⬜ Accessibility improvements
- ⬜ Home screen widget

### Technical Improvements
- ⬜ Comprehensive unit tests
- ⬜ UI tests
- ⬜ Performance optimizations
- ⬜ Error handling improvements
- ⬜ Backend integration for dynamic exchange data

## Current Status

The app is in a functional state with the core time display and update features implemented. Users can see the current time in the header and the local time for each exchange, with automatic updates every minute when the app is active and immediate updates when the app is resumed.

The most recent implementation focused on the time update mechanism, using Android's BroadcastReceiver to listen for system time changes (ACTION_TIME_TICK) instead of a custom timer. This approach is more efficient and battery-friendly.

### Recent Milestone: Automatic Time Updates
- Implemented BroadcastReceiver for time updates
- Added proper lifecycle management
- Modified ViewModel to update time and reload exchanges
- Ensured immediate updates on app resume

## Known Issues

1. **No Exchange Filtering**: Users cannot yet filter which exchanges to display
2. **Limited Error Handling**: Error states need more comprehensive handling
3. **No Persistence for User Preferences**: User preferences are not saved between sessions
4. **No Offline Mode Indicator**: No indication when the app is working offline
5. **Limited Testing**: Need more comprehensive test coverage

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Initial Approach | Current Approach | Reason for Change |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Time Updates** | Timer-based approach | BroadcastReceiver | More efficient, battery-friendly, and aligned with system clock |
| **UI Framework** | XML layouts | Jetpack Compose | Modern, declarative approach with better state management |
| **State Management** | LiveData | StateFlow | Better integration with Kotlin Coroutines and Flow |
| **Database** | SQLite direct | Room | Type safety, better integration with Kotlin |

### Feature Prioritization

1. **Initial Focus**: Core exchange display with static data
2. **Second Phase**: Time calculations and status display
3. **Current Phase**: Automatic time updates
4. **Next Phase**: User preferences and filtering

### Technical Debt

1. **Test Coverage**: Need to improve unit and UI test coverage
2. **Error Handling**: Need more robust error handling throughout the app
3. **Documentation**: Some code sections need better documentation
4. **UI Refinement**: Some UI components need design improvements

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Exchange Filtering**: Implement the ability for users to select which exchanges to display
2. **User Preferences**: Add persistence for user settings using DataStore
3. **UI Improvements**: Enhance the visual design and add animations
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and UI tests
5. **Dark Theme**: Implement support for dark theme

## Lessons Learned

1. **System Integration**: Leveraging system components like BroadcastReceiver can be more efficient than custom implementations
2. **Time Handling**: Working with time zones and time calculations requires careful consideration of edge cases
3. **State Management**: A single state object simplifies UI updates and state management
4. **Lifecycle Awareness**: Proper lifecycle management is crucial for resource-efficient apps
5. **Compose Benefits**: Jetpack Compose significantly simplifies UI development and state management
